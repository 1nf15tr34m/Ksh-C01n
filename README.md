<br><p class="has-text-grey-light">Working in tandem with the CBK Ksh-C01n will work towards digital regulation of cyber currencies and their counterparts once developed there are tangible plans to offer a wide range of services previously unavailable from a single entity. It supports a limited number of digital currencies and trading pairs, and its customer support has been widely criticized by users3. Ksh-C01n integrates fiat support and a user-friendly interface, but offers a much broader range of on-platform functionality (like GDAX and Coinbase in one place, and then some). Plus, we are making customer support a major priority. We believe we are well positioned to provide a competitive alternative to Coinbase and similar platforms in overlapping jurisdictions.</p>
<br><p class="has-text-grey-light">We feel as though the combination of an easy-to-use UI, crypto/fiat support, and advanced trading features already makes Ksh-C01n very competitive in the exchange space. Beyond that, the introduction of our unique investment models (ETCF’s and TAM Accounts) and our turnkey ICO Express engine pushes Ksh-C01n beyond being “just an exchange” and solidifies our vision of being a one-stop, all-in-one platform for crypto.</p>
